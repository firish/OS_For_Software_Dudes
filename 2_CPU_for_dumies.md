## What is the CPU?
Central Processing Unit (CPU): 
The CPU is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside a computer. 
It executes instructions from programs and is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer.

## CPU Processors and CPU Cores
CPU Processor: The processor refers to the entire CPU chip, which can contain multiple cores.
It includes one or more cores, as well as other components such as cache memory and control units.
A single processor can have multiple cores, but it is considered one physical chip.

CPU Cores: A core is an individual processing unit within the CPU. 
Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously (parallel processing). 
For example, a quad-core CPU has four independent cores.

Hence, a quad-core processor will have 1 processor and 4 cores.
A dual quad-core processor will have 2 processors, each with 4 cores.

The most common processor and core combinations in modern laptops and mobile devices are:
- Quad-core processors: These are very common in both laptops and mobile devices. They offer a good balance of performance and power efficiency for a wide range of tasks.
- Hexa-core and Octa-core processors: These are becoming more common, especially in higher-end devices, providing even more performance for demanding applications.

For Apple MacBook Air, the default is 1 processor (M1/M2/M3) with 8 cores (4 low performance and 4 high performance).
For Apple iPhone 14 Pro, the default is 1 processor (Apple A15 Bionic) with Hexa-core (6 cores: 2 high-performance + 4 high-efficiency)
Multiple cores are typically used in servers and high-end workstations. (like the Dell PowerEdge R740)



L1, L2, L3 Cache and Registers
Registers: Small, fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold data that the CPU is currently processing. They are the fastest type of memory but are limited in size.

L1 Cache (Level 1): The smallest and fastest cache located within the CPU core. It is divided into two parts: the instruction cache (stores instructions) and the data cache (stores data).

L2 Cache (Level 2): Larger than L1 but slower, L2 cache is usually located on the CPU chip but outside the core. It serves as a bridge between the fast L1 cache and the slower main memory.

L3 Cache (Level 3): Even larger and slower than L2, L3 cache is shared among all cores in the CPU. It helps reduce the latency between the CPU and the main memory.

Cache Synchronization Problem
Cache Synchronization Problem: This occurs in multi-core systems where each core has its own cache. When one core updates data in its cache, the other cores' caches may become outdated, leading to inconsistency. Solutions like cache coherence protocols (e.g., MESI) ensure that all caches have consistent data.

Clock Speed
Clock Speed: The speed at which a CPU executes instructions, measured in GHz (gigahertz). Higher clock speeds generally mean a faster CPU, but efficiency and architecture also play crucial roles in performance.

Instructions/Machine Level Instructions
Instructions: Basic operations performed by the CPU, defined by the CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA). Examples include arithmetic operations (add, subtract), data movement (load, store), and control operations (jump, branch).

Other Crucial CPU Parts
Control Unit (CU): Directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, ALU, and I/O devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.

Floating Point Unit (FPU): Handles complex mathematical calculations, specifically floating-point arithmetic.

Bus Interface: Manages data transfer between the CPU and other components of the computer (e.g., memory, I/O devices).
