# What is an OS?
Simple: OS is a software system,
that acts as a bridge between the end user (software applications) and the actual hardware (CPU and physical memory). 

# Why do we need an OS?
OS acts an abstraction layer over the hardware.
without it, when running our program, we have to deal with tens of different types of,
CPU/processors, storage systems, memory, I/O devices, and network protocols.
