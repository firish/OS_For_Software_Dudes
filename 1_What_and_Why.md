# Operating System (OS) Overview

## Why Do We Need an OS?

- Manages hardware components: CPU, SSD, hard drive, keyboard, mouse, network card, RAM.
- Acts as an intermediary between applications and hardware.

## Role of the OS

- Manages resource allocation and access.
- Provides abstraction to hardware for applications.
- Handles input/output operations and device communication.
- Manages processes and scheduling.

## Key Functions

1. **Resource Management:**
   - Manages CPU, memory, and I/O resources.
   - Ensures fair resource allocation among processes.

2. **Scheduling:**
   - Preemptive execution allows fair CPU time distribution.
   - Prevents CPU-hogging by a single process.
   - Various scheduling algorithms exist to optimize performance.

3. **Device Management:**
   - Manages communication with hardware devices.
   - Handles device-specific protocols and specifications (e.g., HDMI, VGA).

4. **Memory Management:**
   - Manages virtual and physical memory addresses.
   - Optimizes memory allocation and access.

## Benefits of Understanding the OS

- Appreciation of the complexity and efficiency of OS design.
- Ability to optimize application performance by understanding OS interactions.
- Knowledge of potential inefficiencies and areas for improvement.

## Abstraction Layers

- **POSIX API:** Provides a standard interface for hardware interaction across different OSes.
- **Virtual File System (VFS):** Abstracts file system operations.
- **Block Layer:** Manages block devices (e.g., SSDs, hard drives).
